How to run the measurement script for each TPCDS program:

./measurement-scripts/convenience-wrapper-kernel-stack-time.sh Q1 1 store_returns date_dim store customer
./measurement-scripts/convenience-wrapper-kernel-stack-time.sh Q3 1 store_sales date_dim item
./measurement-scripts/convenience-wrapper-kernel-stack-time.sh Q6 1 customer_address customer store_sales date_dim item
./measurement-scripts/convenience-wrapper-kernel-stack-time.sh Q7 1 customer_demographics promotion store_sales date_dim item
./measurement-scripts/convenience-wrapper-kernel-stack-time.sh Q12 1 web_sales date_dim item
./measurement-scripts/convenience-wrapper-kernel-stack-time.sh Q15 1 catalog_sales customer customer_address date_dim
./measurement-scripts/convenience-wrapper-kernel-stack-time.sh Q19 1 date_dim store_sales item customer customer_address store
./measurement-scripts/convenience-wrapper-kernel-stack-time.sh Q20 1 catalog_sales date_dim item

Copied these commands into measurement-scripts/run-all.sh

Activated history server.
Need to get shuffle read and write values from the history server
Can't do the above automatically since too complex for what it is worth, do manually for now.
Created script to plot shuffle size vs diff sum in measurement scripts

create_ds_levels.py will create datasets of different sizes given a path to a folder with a bunch of datasets
first arg is path to folder containing datasets (partitioned spark style)
second arg is any arbitrary path, this is where the new ones will be stored
Example run:
python3 create_ds_levels.py /home/ahmad/Desktop/spark-playground/DepFuzz/data/tpcds_noheader_nocommas /home/ahmad/Desktop/spark-playground/DepFuzz/data/tpcds_levels


Getting results:
Run the following script.
.measurement-scripts/run-all.sh

The combined results are written to results/global_logs/

Need to get shuffle read and write sizes manually from the history server
clean up the file

Get graphs for a particular program using the following:
python3 measurement-scripts/draw-shufflesize-vs-diffsum.py results/global_logs/cleaned-gl-2024-07-13_01-20-06 Q1 read
